I gave a talk today at [DjangoCon](http://djangocon.us/) 2012 on API design tips. The goal was to help other programmers frame how they think about programming, especially in the code they share with others (commercially, open-source or even with themselves in 6 months).

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="504634a9e76a640002019ac3" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

I've actually wanted to give this talk for at least two years now. While I don't mistake myself for some super-awesome programming guru, there are lots of things (all in the deck) that I've wanted to share with others, especially those with no CS experience.

Hopefully they're useful to others. Enjoy!
