Ben Spaulding will be joining Toast Driven in two weeks as our gentlemanly
"Web Craftsman".

Designer by nature, Ben's been in the Django world for number of years,
flexing his chops on a variety of both commercial & open source projects.
In addition to his skills with all things frontend, his solid grasp of
Python & Django are going to be put to good use. He has a couple Django
apps up on [GitHub](https://github.com/benspaulding),
most notably [django-faq](https://github.com/benspaulding/django-faq).

He'll also be helping launch a new service or two with Toast Driven in the
coming weeks!
