This year has been a busy one for [Toast Driven][td], your Django Dash hosts.
In addition to the pace Daniel keeps, I ([Ben Spaulding][bs]), have joined
Toast Driven. With all the goings-on we were unable to plan the Dash for the
usual mid-summer time. However, we are excited to announce that the Dash is
officially scheduled for mid-August.

If you have participated in the Dash before you can head on over to the
[registration page][rg] once it opens. If this is your first time, have a look
at [the rules][rl] and [FAQ][fq]. And no matter who you are, once registration
begins you ought to check out the [list of teams][tm] to see who is having all
the fun, and [the sponsors][sp] who make it all possible.

So, talk to some friends and get a team together. Everyone wants to see what
you’ve got up your sleeve. At the very least you’ll have fun. Most likely
you’ll use your project and ideas in the future. And who knows, maybe your
project will really [take off][rtd].
