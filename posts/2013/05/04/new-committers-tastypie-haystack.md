A couple months ago, I posted a blog entry asking for help with Tastypie &
Haystack. I was burnt-out, facing lots of upheaval & frustrated by my inability
to keep up with all the issues/PRs that come in for both projects. I wasn't
expecting much of a response, but I was surprised by the number who did.

Now that I've had a chance to get settled (moving sucks), I wanted to take
this chance to thank all the new committers to both projects!

For now, I'm not looking for any more committers (pull requests are always
welcome). Partly because there's significantly more people on both projects
now & I/everyone else are still working out how to coordinate things. Thanks
again to everyone who's volunteered to help!
