For Kenneth Love's new "[Getting Started With Django](http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/)"
series, I wrote an original song for the intro/outro. Not sure it's worth a long
post, but I thought I'd write up a little on it.

If you like it, you can download an [MP3 version](http://toastdriven.com/static/sound/GSwD - Bloopy.mp3)
or listen & follow me on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/skiplist). The song
itself is Creative Commons-Attribution.

Origin
------

When the [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/657368266/getting-started-with-django)
for the project initially funded, Kenneth & I had been talking for a week or so
about how it was going. I asked if he had anything planned for music (since
he'd have to license music, as the videos could be construed as "public
performance"). He said he didn't have any plans, so I offered to try to kick
something out that he could use if he'd like.

As far as guidelines went, Kenneth gave me one simple request: "upbeat". Not
exactly the headstart I was looking for, but plenty of rope to hang myself. :)

Production
----------

Producing the track took a number of tries. If you're curious, you can listen
to the [earlier drafts](https://soundcloud.com/skiplist/sets/gswd).

I produced all variants on my iPad 3, using [BeatMaker 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beatmaker-2/id417020234?mt=8).
For some of the early sketching, I had my Behringer UMX25 USB MIDI keyboard
hooked up through the [Camera Connector Kit](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A/apple-ipad-camera-connection-kit),
though almost all work was done just manipulating the piece directly through
BeatMaker. No samples were used, pretty much all just the built-in instruments
& a fair amount of additional manipulation.

The first attempt (& three subsequent draft) was mostly focused on the idea of
"upbeat". I was kinda going for a chill island sound, with a fuzzed/punchy
bass bubbling through. The various reactions I got were positive, but I don't
think it was what anyone expected.

I had settled on a final refined version, but decided to do an alternate version
just voices with different instruments. I went through a couple variations &
while I was happier with the newer sound, it still didn't feel right.

About a week before the deadline we had imposed, I asked Kenneth for a weekend
to experiment with a completely different sound. I decided to go for a more
chiptune-style sound & was very pleased with the results. The people I had
listen to it also liked it much better. Three revisions with lots of polish
later yielded the final result.

All total, I spent close to 23 hours on the song.

Lessons Learned
---------------

Some people are musical geniuses who can just crank out original works, but
**a)** they are far & few between and **b)** I am not one of them. Music is
an iterative process for me, something that start with a small notion or phrase
& is built/endlessly-rebuilt on top of that. You spent an enormous amount of
time with a given section looping over & over again, as you refine away at it.
And what sounds good one night sounds like utter garbage the next day.

Hope everyone enjoys the song & I'd love to hear feedback!
