![I Want You](http://toastdriven.com/static/img/wsgi-war-wants-you.jpg)

This year, I'm starting a new competition for Python web developers called
the [WSGI War](http://wsgiwar.com/). I've been running the [Django Dash](http://djangodash.com/) for seven years now &
have been frequently told that people wish there were something similar for
the broader community. Well, now there is.

The format is a 48-hour programming contest that happens 100% online (though
you're free to meet with others in person). You may use any Python web framework
(though it should really speak WSGI). You can have a team of up to three
people, though team size doesn't affect judging & 1-2 person teams have done
very well in the past. The full rules can be seen at
http://wsgiwar.com/2013/rules/.

It's a chance to challenge yourself, push your skills & see what you can really
do under a time crunch. People have loved competing in the Dash in previous
years, so hopefully the rest of the Python web community will too.


Registration Starts Sept. 14!
-----------------------------

Importantly, registration for the War will be opening in less than two weeks
(September 14)! Registration is open just for **ONE WEEK** (closing on
September 21) then the competition happens one week later (September 28-29).


Sponsors Needed!
----------------

Finally, I'm looking for sponsors. Sponsoring is prize-based & just involves
committing to providing a prize (or prizes) to a winning team. If you have a
service or a product, those make great prizes (& publicity) as well! The prizes
don't have to be big (some of the best loved ones are Amazon gift cards or
shirts) and can be whatever you're comfortable offering.

If you or your company would like to sponsor some prizes,
please email me - daniel AT toastdriven DOT com.
