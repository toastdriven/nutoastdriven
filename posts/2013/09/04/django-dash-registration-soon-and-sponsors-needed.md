This year's [Django Dash](http://djangodash.com/) is coming up quick, so I wanted to announce some
things as a reminder.

For those who aren't familiar with it, the [Django Dash](http://djangodash.com/) is a 48-hour
programming competition for people who use Django. It's open to anyone (takes
place 100% online). You can find more information & the rules at
http://djangodash.com/2013/rules/.

Registration Starts Sept. 14!
-----------------------------

The contest is entering its **seventh** year this year & registration
for teams will be opening in less than two weeks (September 14)! Registration
is open for **ONE WEEK** (closing on September 21) then the competition happens
one week later (September 28-29).

So get your team of up to three people together, be ready to register & start
thinking of ideas for the contest!


Sponsors Needed!
----------------

I'm also looking for more sponsors for this year's competition. If you or your
company would like to sponsor some prizes (big or small), please email me
- daniel AT toastdriven DOT com. I promise it's an easy process.
