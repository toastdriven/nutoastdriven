**TL;DR** I'm stepping back from Tastypie & Haystack soon and am looking for 3-7
people *per project* to step up & help take over.

[Tastypie](http://tastypieapi.org/) and [Haystack](http://haystacksearch.org/)
have both grown far more than I ever expected & could hope for. But that's
proven to be a double-edged sword, as they've also outgrown my ability to
support them, let alone supporting them both at once.

Additionally, they were both projects built out of love/desire on personal
time (with scant business-backed time). That worked at the start, but I haven't
worked day-to-day with either of them in a long time. And certainly not as much 
as many people have come to use them.

So I'm looking for people to add to the *committers*. Given the current backlog
& the kind-of-insane issue/PR flow (I got over 100 requests last month alone),
I'm hoping that at least 3 (& hopefully many more) people are willing to
stand up for **each** of them & help them move forward.

### The Ideal Committer

The kind of people I'm looking for are:

* Use the project on a frequent basis
* Care about code quality/standards
* Write tests to cover the patches they're committing/merging
* Can follow the [contribution guidelines](http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html#guidelines-for-contributing-code)
* Want to do something good for the community

### "Sounds Great! How Do I Express Interest?"

Pretty simple.

* Create two pull requests on the project that meet both the
[contributing](http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html#guidelines-for-contributing-code)
and the [core committer](http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html#guidelines-for-core-contributors) guidelines
* Send an email to "daniel@toastdriven.com" with the **Subject** "I Wanna Be A <Project> Committer".
Include a link to both pull requests and a short description as to why you'd
like to be involved.
* If the PRs are straight-away mergable, congrats! I'll add you to the committers
and you can merge away.
* If not, I'll try to work with you & get things to a point where you can
merge freely, then will grant you access.

### What About You? Why Now?

As I've said, I don't get to work with either project very much.
I've tried maintaining them on the side but I can't keep up & the rest of the
core team on each side are either busy or no longer use it themselves.

The timing is because I'm going to be moving cross-country shortly. Additionally,
my next job may not even involve Django & certainly won't use Tastypie/Haystack.

I still intend to be involved where I can. I'm putting the finishing touches on a
major release for Tastypie this week, and intend to port both Tastypie & Haystack
to be Python 3 compatible in the short-term. And I'll be paying for the
domains/admin-ing the mailing lists/etc. ad infinitum. I care a whole lot about
both projects, but it's time others with more time/energy/motivation took the
reins.
