# Going "Home"

As of March 17, I'm leaving <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span>, by my
choice after just over a year. I'll be packing up the family & we're going to be moving
(back) to Lawrence, KS.

I'm not leaving because I'm cashing out big time (on the contrary, I owe
<span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> for leaving before the two year mark).
I'm leaving the job & Seattle itself because we're unhappy here. Let's
define unhappy as "upset enough to cause 10 months of severe chest & stomach
pain", deep depression & packing 20+ lbs back on despite no change in
diet/exercise.

I'm not holding it against them; the <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span>
services are great & I'll be continuing to use them. But the corporate world &
big city life are not for me.

Let's talk about Seattle...

## Reasons To Live In Seattle

* The area surrounding the city is classic PNW. Pretty, between the mountains &
  enormous conifers everywhere
* Big city, so lots of choices & lots of different places to be, if you can
  spare the time or can live right where you want to be
* Bicycle-friendly - Lots of trails & places to ride

## Reasons Not To Live In Seattle

* **Gray** - It mists more than it actually rains (say goodbye to thunderstorms) &
  only expect to see the sun for a couple months of the year
* **Big** - If you live outside the city proper, expect an hour+ commute for
  pretty much everything. I-5 is a shitshow & the terrible drivers don't make it
  any better
* **Rude** - If you're used to big cities, maybe it's fine, but I found people
  everywhere to be pretty rude/cold

## Why Move?

What's in Lawrence, you say? (or maybe you didn't...) Isn't the whole Midwest
just "fly over" states?

It's the exception to the Kansas rule, a liberal little college town.
Conveniently, it's a short drive to Kansas City (less time than it takes us to
drive to downtown Seattle), but retains an indie spirit. The longest possible
commute in the city is 15 minutes. There's an excellent selection of
restaurants, great coffeeshops/bars & awesome music. It doesn't completely
shutdown at 6pm (thanks for nothing, Lynnwood). And it's centrally located,
both to our family as well as the continental US, meaning driving or flights
to anywhere are easy.

This may not sound exciting to you, but it does sound like home to me.
