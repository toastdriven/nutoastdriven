<p>It's getting to be that time of year again, so (a day late) let's throw this out there. Since many people enjoyed it last year, I will be running the <a href="http://djangodash.com/">Django Dash</a> again this year.</p>

<h3>When?</h3>

<p>May 30 @ 12:00 am CST to May 31 @ 11:59 pm CST. (This does not collide with <a href="http://euro.djangocon.org/">EuroDjangoCon</a>.)</p>

<h3>Who?</h3>

<p>Anyone who enjoys the <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework may participate, which includes core devs as well if they're interested. So be you a developer or designer (or something in-between), you should participate.</p>

<p>Teams of 2 were the standard last year, but I'm willing to be flexible on this if people are interested in bigger teams. Three might be nice but it depends on interest.</p>

<h3>What Is Django Dash?</h3>

<p>A 48-hour web development contest for perfectionists with deadlines, of course! What better way to push your skills and have some fun?</p>

<h3>I Want More Info!</h3>

<p>I'll be posting periodically to the website and to Twitter (@<a href="http://twitter.com/djangodash/">djangodash</a>). Expect more details to start emerging within the next two weeks.</p>
