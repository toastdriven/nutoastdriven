<p>It's been quiet here lately for many reasons. Part burnout from the November blogging, part being busy with work. But the other component has been a couple interesting open source projects and community projects. The first, <a href="http://github.com/toastdriven/itty/">itty</a>, was released awhile back and was a fun foray into microframeworks that has actually proved quite useful.</p>

<p>The second, and much larger, project has been consuming much of my off time since January. I'm putting the finishing touches on the initial release, which I hope to kick out the door by the weekend. I think it has potential but we'll see how things shake out. Expect an announcement by next week.</p>

<p>And finally, as these things spin down, the next <a href="http://djangodash.com/">Django Dash</a> will be starting up. Things are looking promising there again this year and the code could use some love and some new features.</p>

<p>As ever, more soon...</p>
