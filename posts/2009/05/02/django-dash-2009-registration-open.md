<p>
    The 2009 <a href="http://djangodash.com/">Django Dash</a> is now open for
    registration! The Dash is a 48-hour programming competition to build the
    best Django-powered website. People who want to compete should mosey on over to the
    <a href="http://djangodash.com/registration/">registration</a> page, signup
    for an account and start forming their teams. Make sure to read through the
    rules first.
</p>

<p>
    I'm really excited as this year's Dash is shaping up to be really great.
    With an extra team member allowed per team and some tweaks to the
    third-party code guidelines, there's a little more flexibility to be had.
    Last year's entries were really good and I think this year's will be even
    better.
</p>

<p>
    And a huge thank you to this year's gracious
    <a href="http://djangodash.com/sponsors/">sponsors</a>. Even though times
    are somewhat rougher this year than last, we have four more sponsors than
    last year (up from 6 to 10) and some really sweet prizes to boot. All of the
    sponsors have my appreciation for their donations.
</p>

<p>
    Registration ends on May 23rd, so there are roughly three weeks to register.
    The Django Dash itself will be held on the last weekend of May, the 30-31st.

    has a <a href="http://twitter.com/djangodash">Twitter</a> feed, so feel free
    to either follow or grab the RSS.
