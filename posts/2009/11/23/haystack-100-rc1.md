<p>
    After almost a full year of development, 
    <a href="http://haystacksearch.org/">Haystack</a> has been marked as 1.0.0,
    release candidate 1. I'd recommend all users upgrade, as it is what Haystack
    1.0.0-final will be unless any bugs are found. Should all go well, I'll be
    releasing 1.0.0-final next Sunday (Nov. 29, 2009).
</p>

<p>
    The release is available via 
    <a href="http://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack">git</a>, via
    <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-haystack">PyPi</a> and as
    a tarball from
    <a href="http://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/downloads">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
    It's been a lot of work and lots of good contributions. I'm glad to finally
    be in the home stretch and will post something more substantial when
    1.0.0-final drops.
