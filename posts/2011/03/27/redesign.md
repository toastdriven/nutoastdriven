Its been a couple years since I originally launched the Toast Driven site. In
that time, it has fallen to the wayside as other projects became more
important. So it was due for an overhaul.

In the process, I've removed some of the dead weight from the site. I've
streamlined the site so that almost all information is right up front on the
[home](/) page. I've revamped the entire [blog](/blog/) setup (which
unfortunately broke URLs but for the better). And I've removed the comments,
which were never very heavily used & collected spam more than anything else.

I have some more improvements planned, but wanted to get the new site up &
running as soon as I could. Enjoy!
