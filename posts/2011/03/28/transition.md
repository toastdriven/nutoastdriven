Spring is a time of change and I have a change of my own in store. I am
sad & excited to announce that I'll be leaving
[Mediaphormedia](http://ellingtoncms.com/) & running Toast Driven as my
full-time business, primarily as a consultancy.

### Why Leave MPM?

[Adrian](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/311/) and
[Jacob](http://jacobian.org/writing/sailing-on/) have tread this ground before,
and while I'm not the luminaries they are, I want to address reasons up front.

I started at Mediaphormedia (a.k.a. The World Company) just under three years
ago. When I got there, [Ellington](http://ellingtoncms.com/) was still running
on Django 0.91 & the team had just gotten three new developers, hired
specifically to port Ellington to the impending Django 1.0 release.

In my time there, I got to contribute to:

* Porting Ellington to Django 1.0, then 1.1, then 1.2.
* Adding extensive test coverage to Ellington.
* Revamping search in both Ellington & Marketplace.
* Launching Marketplace's API & laying the groundwork for Ellington's.
* Plus many more smaller projects.

However, it has long been a dream of mine to run my own company and now, more
than ever before, it feels like it's time for me to pursue that.

Since I am leaving, MPM is looking for a few good developers at all
levels. If you want a full-time job doing
[Python](http://python.org/) & [Django](http://djangoproject.com/) with some of
the best developers around, I'd encourage you to apply. Drop me an
[email](mailto:daniel@toastdriven.com) and I'll put you in touch with the right
people.

### What's In Store For Toast Driven?

Effective May 9th, 2011, Toast Driven will be open for business. Officially,
the focus will be web development, but I don't think it'll surprise anyone if
I say I'll be focusing on Django-based development. That said, a successful
web application usually incorporates many different technologies & my goal
is to support those as well.

I'll be, at least initially, accepting contracts on a limited
basis. I've already accepted several contracts, so what's left of my time is
on a first-come, first-serve basis.

In addition, I'm planning on offering commercial support for
[Haystack](http://haystacksearch.org/) and
[Tastypie](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie). Which means I'll
be offering both implementing new features in those projects as well as
top-notch integrations in other people's codebases.

And of course, I'll be helping run the [Django Dash](http://djangodash.com/)
again this year with my [Pragmatic Badger](http://pragmaticbadger.com/)
cohorts. And there's a secret project or two kicking around that I hope to
give some time & love to that will fly the Toast Driven banner once they're
public.
