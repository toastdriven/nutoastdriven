<p>Everyone’s new favorite web development shop opens for business. Toast Driven launches as work begins on it’s first major project. The application is expected to launch in early June 2008 as a publicly available beta.</p>

<p>Toast Driven does both consulting as well as product development using current web technologies. We take great pride in the sites we create, ensuring they follow standards and are accessible. We think that content, presentation and behavior are at their best when they're properly separated. And we love happy customers.</p>
