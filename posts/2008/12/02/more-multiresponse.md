<p>The source for <code>MultiResponse</code> is now under version control (via <a href="http://github.com/toastdriven/multiresponse/">GitHub</a>). It's also been improved to no longer require file extensions/URLconf hacking (thanks <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/nov/29/multiresponse/">James</a>/<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/">mimeparse</a>). The result is shorter and faster code with the same API.</p>
