<p>I like statistics.  Even though the saying goes "There are lies, damned lies and statistics", I still think they are fun. So, as promised (though slightly late), here are some interesting facts about the Django Dash competition:</p>

<p><ul><br /><li><strong>Most Unique Visitors In A Day:</strong> 749</li><br /><li><strong>People Interested Pre-Dash:</strong> 113</li><br /><li><strong>Teams That Signed Up For The Dash:</strong> 52</li><br /><li><strong>People That Signed Up For The Dash:</strong> 69</li><br /><li><strong>Teams That Competed In The Dash:</strong> 11</li><br /><li><strong>People That Competed In The Dash:</strong> 17</li><br /><li><strong>Original Length Of The Dash:</strong> 48 hours</li><br /><li><strong>Actual Length Of The Dash:</strong> 96 hours</li><br /><li><strong>Time During Original Length Dash Server Was Up:</strong> 17 hours</li><br /><li><strong>Total Time Dash Server Was Up:</strong> 36 hours</li><br /><li><strong>Prizes Given Away:</strong> 24</li><br /><li><strong>Max Place That Won Prizes:</strong> 8th</li><br /><li><strong>Number Of Winning Teams With 2 Members:</strong> 5 (1st - 5th)</li><br /><li><strong>Number Of Winners Using Gmail:</strong> 10 (76%)</li><br /><li><strong>Estimate Total Value Of Prizes:</strong> $6,692</li><br /><li><strong>Time Required To Judge The Competition:</strong> 12 hours total</li><br /><li><strong>Beers Consumed During Judging:</strong> 4 total</li><br /></ul></p>

<p>Overall, I'm really impressed. I'm glad people stuck with it during the downtime and that we had as good of a turnout as we did. I'm planning on running this again next year as the feedback was overall very positive.</p>

<p>On the topic of judging, the single most critical factor was if we (myself & the judges) could get the apps up and working.  Only one team provided a README, which was very helpful. Meanwhile, 2 of the teams that competed couldn't even be gotten up and running, which hurt them badly (can't judge much but the code itself).</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun, despite the downtime, and I hope the teams that competed did too.</p>
