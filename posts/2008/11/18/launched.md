<p>As a point of historical note, the sites that caused Django to be created, <a href="http://www.ljworld.com/">LJWorld</a>, <a href="http://www.lawrence.com/">Lawrence.com</a> and <a href="http://www.kusports.com/">KUSports.com</a> have all launched on Ellington running on Django 1.0! It's been a long process to get here, and we have a little ways to go yet, but this is a very satisfying moment.</p>
