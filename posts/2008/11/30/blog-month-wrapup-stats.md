<p>As seems to be the standard elsewhere, this is a wrap up post for the <a href="http://www.nablopomo.com/">National Blog Posting Month</a>. First, some lies/damned lies/statistics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Total posts: 31</li>
    <li>Total words: 14604</li>
    <li>Average post length in words: 471</li>
    <li>Total code samples: 54</li>
    <li>Django-related posts: 19</li>
    <li>Posts mentioning Rails: 6 (Ha! Meta-mention!)</li>
    <li>Missed days: 0</li>
    <li>Total visits: 3,530</li>
    <li>Total pageviews: 6,845</li>
    <li>Average time to create each post: ~1.5 hours</li>
    <li>Average time each visitor stayed on the site: 1 minute, 37 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>This month was way harder and took way more effort than I thought it would. Some of it was very worthwhile but I somewhat resent the time it took away from other things (family, coding, having fun). I'm going to take a break for a while to focus on other things but I've got quite a few topics left from my initial generation of ideas to last me for a little while.</p>
