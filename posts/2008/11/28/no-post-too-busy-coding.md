<p>Tonight's entry is delayed as I'm working on a potentially interesting piece of code for Django. One thing I have missed from my time in Rails-land is <code>respond_to</code>, which allowed you to serve up different formats based on the <code>Accept</code> header found in the request. So I'm working on crafting something similar. If it works out alright for me, I'll post it here tomorrow night.</p>
