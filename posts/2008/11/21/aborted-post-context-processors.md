<p>Well crap. I was going to write about <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/#id1">context processors</a> but <a href="http://www.b-list.org/">James</a> already did <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/jun/14/django-tips-template-context-processors/">one</a> and two years ago at that, natch. This leaves me throwing out everything I just wrote as well as the two code samples. It also leaves me with no motivation.</p>
