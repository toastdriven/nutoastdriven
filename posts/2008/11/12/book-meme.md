<blockquote>"Did you have something special in mind?"</blockquote>

<p>From <em>The Essential Calvin And Hobbes</em>.</p>

<p>Found via <a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2008/11/12/book_meme/">James Tauber</a>. To do the meme dance:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Grab the nearest book.</li>
    <li>Open it to page 56.</li>
    <li>Find the fifth sentence.</li>
    <li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.</li>
    <li>Don't dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.</li>
