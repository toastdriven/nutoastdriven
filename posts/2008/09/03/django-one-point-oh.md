<p>Though you will see it many other places on the web, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> has reached <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2008/sep/03/1/">1.0</a> status! My congratulations to the people that made it happen (both core and community). It's been a hell of a ride so far and I'm anxious to see (and hopefully contribute to) what comes next.</p>
