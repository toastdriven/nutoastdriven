<p>For those who'd like a sweeping introduction to Django, especially in testing, a coworker of mine's site is a phenomenal resource. Eric Holscher's <a href="http://ericholscher.com/">Surfing In Kansas</a> has had a number of good posts on testing. An especially good reference is the recent <a href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/oct/5/django-tips/">Django tips</a>. Eric's on his way to being a Django testing authority, so I think we can expect to see more good things in the future.</p>
