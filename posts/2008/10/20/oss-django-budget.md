<p>More open-source for everyone's consumption. This time, it's a personal budgeting application, released under the name <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-budget/">django-budget</a>. It replaces our old &amp; mouldy Excel spreadsheet that just wasn't cutting it anymore.</p>

<p>It's reusable, decently-tested and already very helpful. It won't be everything to everyone but it works very well for us. And there's a lot of interesting possibilities for extending this to be even more helpful (checkbook reconciliation and a mobile friendly version come to mind).</p>

<p>I'm not including templates by default on this one and the templates I have released alongside it are simply for either duplicating our setup or reference, AKA not supported and never will be.</p>

<p>Yay for scratching an (much needed, personal) itch.</p>
