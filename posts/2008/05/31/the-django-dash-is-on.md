<p>The fruit of the last two months of my labor is in progress. <a href="http://www.djangodash.com/" title="Django Dash">Django Dash</a> had a decent response and I'm excited to see what comes out of it, not to mention some pretty sweet prizes for the winners. We had to scale back the final site due to Real Lifeâ„¢ circumstances but it still should make it a little interesting to watch.</p>

<p>More after the competition is complete, including lessons learned.</p>
