<p>We're going out on a limb here. We've added this crazy new concept we just came across called "comments". Apparently, a whole bunch of "blogs" as well as "social software" (whatever that means) have this idea that people visiting the "page" should be able to leave feedback about the "content" right there on the site itself! This is revolutionary! We have NO IDEA how this is going to play out, so let's call this a "beta" feature for now.</p>

<p>Sarcasm complete: check. Added comments to Toast Driven's Fresh News: check. Pointless update pointing out new functionality that should've been there from the start: check. We now return you to your regularly scheduled web surfing.</p>
