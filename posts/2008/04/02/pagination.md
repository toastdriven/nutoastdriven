<p>The Fresh News section now features pagination thanks to the awesome new <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/pagination/" title="Paginator">Paginator</a> object in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" title="Django">Django</a>. So easy and such a nice API.  It added perhaps 4 lines to my view and maybe 15 lines (mostly structural or simple conditionals) to my template and works beautifully.</p>

<p>We've got 2 other larger Django things in the works, hopefully one landing this weekend for the entire community and another next week for Django's documentation. More as it develops (literally)!</p>
