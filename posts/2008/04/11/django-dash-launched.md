<p>The latest (and ongoing) project for Toast Driven has just launched! We're hosting the first <a href="http://www.djangodash.com/" title="Django Dash">Django Dash</a>, a 48 hour start-to-finish competition for the Django community. We've been working largely on the site, getting the details organized and laying out the work over the next few weeks. We've got some decent plans for the site during the competition, which may involve a sneak peak at our first big product. We're excited to see what the community produces and hope everyone has a little fun in the process.</p>

<p>If you, or someone/some company you know, would be interested in sponsoring the competition, we'd like to hear from you. We're hoping to collect some prizes together to award to the best applications that come out of the Dash. Please <a href="/contact/" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> if you're interested or refer to the <a href="http://www.djangodash.com/sponsors/" title="Sponsors - Django Dash">sponsors</a> page for details.</p>
